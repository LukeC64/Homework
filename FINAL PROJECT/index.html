      <p>Hey there! My name is Luke Campana. I'm a Computer Science student currently learning about Web Development and multiple Programming Languages.</p>

      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hi, I’m Luke! I’m a Computer Science student passionate about technology, gaming, and problem-solving. I enjoy repairing and customizing gaming systems, exploring creative stories through movies and anime, and staying active through sports and fitness. I believe in balancing work, hobbies, and personal growth to stay inspired and focused.</p>

      <p>I love taking apart and fixing gaming systems and computers, whether it's for repairs, upgrades, or custom mods. I'm also a big fan of movies and anime, always looking for stories that spark imagination and creativity.</p>

      <p>Staying active is a big part of my lifestyle too—I hit the gym regularly to stay strong and focused. And when I need a reset, I turn to nature for peace and inspiration. Whether it's through a hike in the woods or a break outdoors, I believe in finding balance between screen time, gym time, and green time.</p>
